[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/tiggreen/booknshelf.svg?token=5yTUaMZbo4c2WU4m6zsD&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/tiggreen/booknshelf)

Booknshelf is your online bookshelf that helps you to stay organized with your books.

More specifically you can use Booknshelf to:

- search for books or discover new ones from curated topics
- easily organize your books in online shelves
- connect with friends and other readers to see what they are reading
- follow different topics and like books

However, this is just the beginning! I've talked about the long term goal of this project in [my post](https://medium/@tik).

Get started using booknshelf on the [booknshelf.com website](https://booknshelf.com).

## Setting up Local Development environment
You need these instructions to run Booknshelf locally.

Booknshelf is a [Laravel](https://laravel.com) application powered by [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/) framework in the frontend.
The easiest way to run Booknshelf locally is to use [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/valet) or [Laravel Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/homestead) to
setup the local environment. After setting it up you will need to run `php artisan migrate` to migrate the database and generate the schema.

At this point you should be all set. Ask me anything if you experience any issues along the way.

To fully function website locally you will need to obtain some keys as mentioned in `.env.example` file.
