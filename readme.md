We are getting busier which means that reading or finishing books is getting harder.

Booknshelf helps you to read more books by making sure you're on top of your books.

More specifically it helps you:

- search for books or discover new ones from curated topics
- easily organize your current and past books in online shelves
- connect with friends and other readers to see what they are reading

However, this is just the beginning! If you want to learn more about the long term goal of Booknshelf then please read [my post](https://medium/@tik).
